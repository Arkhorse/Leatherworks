# Leatherworks
Leatherworks is a mod, that gives players a way to renew leather to craft and mend items in the game and/or added by other mods.

* Find treebark to create tanning
* Turn prepared treebark into different foods or create flour from grinding a large amount of fried prepared bark with a hammer or stone
* Scrape animal hides to get scraped leather
* Soak scraped leather in tanning to get raw leather down the line

The mod may be expanded upon, but currently I have no ideas of my own to add, so suggestions are welcome.

## Changelog

**V1.0:**

* Added treebark. Spawn chance can be tweaked in settings
* Added recipes for tanning, bark noodles and bark bannock, both in normal bark and birch bark variants (Birch bark variant is currently missing its restore condition buff)
* Fry prepared treebark, which can be done both singularly or in a pile, into a snack or to grind it down into flour. 
* Added the option to scrape animal hides. Can be tweaked in settings, if this would apply for only cured or cured and fresh hides
* Added scraped leather, which can be acquired from scraping hide
* Added 3 different variations of the metal box. Filled with tanning, leather soaking in tanning (This can cure both indoors and outdoors) and leather finished soaking (harvest to get your raw leather, which then has to air dry)
